==================== INSTALL ====================
To install this skin, 
run the program named "Skin Installer Ultimate.exe"
click the check boxes of the skins you want (only choose one shen) then click install 
BE VERY PATIENT

You must also use this same program to uninstall the skins before you apply a LoL Patch update.  The update will fail if you do not.

==================== ADVANCED ====================
To use the sonic skin instead of the shadow skin, you either need to buy the LoL skin for the yellow jacket, or alternativly. Rename the files. For example, rename shen_yellowjacket.dss to shen_tex_v4.dss and vice versa, to switch to the sonic skin.

If you do not with to use the Skin Installer program, you may alternativly open the skins folder/ skin you want, and copy the files into your LoL install.  Just make sure you backup everything, and.. sounds wont work till you do the fsbext thing
